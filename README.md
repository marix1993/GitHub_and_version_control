### What is Git?

- Git is a version control system used to track changes in files and collaborate with others on software development projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's changes.

### What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, making it easier for developers to collaborate on code and track changes. It also offers additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews.

### What is the difference between Git and GitHub? How do they interact?
- Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. Git can be used without GitHub, but GitHub cannot be used without Git. They interact by allowing developers to use Git to track changes and collaborate on code, while using GitHub to host the Git repositories and provide additional features for collaboration.

### Benefits of version control:
- Version control allows developers to track changes to code over time, collaborate with others on a codebase, revert to previous versions of code, and maintain a history of changes for future reference.

### Main Git commands:
- git init: initializes a new Git repository
- git add: adds changes to the staging area
- git commit: saves changes to the repository with a commit message
- git push: uploads local changes to a remote repository
- git branch: creates a new branch or lists existing branches
- git merge: merges changes from one branch into another
- git pull: downloads changes from a remote repository to a local repository

### Other useful Git commands:
- git status: shows the status of changes in the repository
- git log: shows a history of commits in the repository
- git clone: creates a copy of a remote repository on a local machine
- git stash: temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed

### What are branches? What is merging/git merge? What is a Pull request?
- Branches are separate lines of development that can be created within a Git repository. They allow developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. Git merge is the command used to perform a merge. A Pull request is a feature of GitHub that allows developers to propose changes to a repository by submitting a request to merge their changes into the main codebase. It provides a way for other developers to review the proposed changes and give feedback before merging them into the main branch.
